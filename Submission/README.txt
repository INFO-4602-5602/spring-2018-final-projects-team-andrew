Final Project: Understanding Dimension Reduction

Andrew Glaws

Description:

In this project, we explore high-dimensional spaces and dimension reduction. The goal is to provide the user with intuition into high dimensional spaces. We provide several static, animated, and interactive visualizations that describe various aspects of high-dimensional spaces. Descriptions on using the interactive visualizations are provided on the page.


To run this project:

(i) open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the .html file

(ii) set up a Python server using 

python -m SimpleHTTPServer		--> if you are using Python version 2.X

python -m http.server			--> if you are using Python version 3.X

(iii) in your web browser (preferable Firefox or Chrome), enter

localhost:8000/finalProject.html

into your address bar

NOTE: I've had some issues with scaling images for various machines so you may need to zoom in/out to see the figures well.
